## ToolQuestionAnswers

This namespace will contain classes that match the short of a `ToolQuestion`, these tool questions need some additional 
code upon saving.

These classes should be triggered by the ToolQuestionAnswerObserver. It's intended to keep the custom code logic 
separated from the observer itself.
