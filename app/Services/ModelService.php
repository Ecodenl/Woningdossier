     * In some cases there are models / tables that have multiple element_ids with different element_value_ids (we take the building_elements table as example).
     *
     * row examples:
     * 1 row
     * element_id = 8
     * element_value_id = 34
     * 2 row
     * element_id = 8
     * element_value_id = 35
     *
     * if its saved like that then its probably a multiselect / checkbox, so if the checkbox with element_value_id 35 gets deselected then we dont know that
     * so we have to delete everything that has a element_id 8 and then we have to reinsert the new data
     *
     * Delete the records with the matching the attributes and create it with the given values
     *
     * @param $model
