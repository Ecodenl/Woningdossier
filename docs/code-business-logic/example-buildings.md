# Example buildings

The example buildings are a important aspect of Hoomdossier, they prefill the input source for a user in the early stage of the scan.

The logic that is applied is as follows
- Create prefilled data based on the fixed tool questions, fixed tool questions can never be overwritten by the example building
- Overwrite the example buildings values with the prefilled data
- Save it to the input source of the user.
