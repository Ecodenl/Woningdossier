#Woonplan

####How does the Woonplan work?

The Woonplan lists the advices that Hoomdossier gives you in different categories (to-do, later and complete), the advices on the Woonplan will be generated once after every Quickscan step has been completed.

Those advices will be assigned to a category, the user may change these in the Woonplan by dragging them to different categories.


The user could make a change in the Quickscan, for instance the user has set his floor insulation to "Geen isolatie". This would result in the floor insulation advice being set under the to-do category.
If the user want's to change the floor insulation to "Matige isolatie (tot 8 cm isolatie)" we want the floor-insulation advice to move in the "later" category.
