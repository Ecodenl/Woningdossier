## Setup

### The server
There are multiple ways to get the development environment up and running. How 
you run it is a matter of taste.

Options:
- [Vagrant + ansible](docs/setup/vagrant-ansible.md)
- Docker (will follow later)
- Homestead

### The application



## PHP version
PHP 7.1 is the current targeted version as this is required by Laravel 5.5.

## Conventions
The woningdossier is based on Laravel 5.5 LTS. Our goal is to confirm as much as 
possible to the conventions by the framework (i.e. PSR-4 autoloading).
